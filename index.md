# Learning how to use Markdown

I've created a new file and formatted a heading. Next, I'll include a random image- but it will remain at the bottom of the document since it is a large image.

```
Python
print("Currently, the only coding language I'm familiar with is Python.")
print("... and maybe a very small amount of html. I have been interested in learning Markdown for awhile.")
```

#### Here is my new task list:

- [X] Create task list with correct formatting...
- [x] Check the preview to make sure indentation and everything else is set up correctly
- [X] Mark off your tasks!
